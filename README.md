# E-Commerce Backend
This repository holds the code for my e-commerce backend application. 

## Description
This application will use sequelize to manage CRUD operations via a mysql database.

## Usage

Utilize the mysql shell (SOURCE ./db/schema.sql) to run the schema at ./db/schema.sql.
Use "npm run seed" to seed the database using ./seeds/index.js.
Use "npm start server.js" to start the application locally at port 3001.

Once the server is running, you can test CRUD operations via insomnia.
